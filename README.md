# Social Media Addiction Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing students' social media addiction using
data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore
behavioral patterns and build predictive models based on students' usage data.

---

## Project Objectives
- Analyze students' social media usage behavior
- Identify factors related to social media addiction
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for prediction
- Extract meaningful insights from data

---

## Data Analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualized key relationships between usage behavior and addiction levels
- Analyzed correlations between features and addiction scores

---

## Machine Learning
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Built classification models to predict social media addiction
- Evaluated models using standard metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

---

## Software Engineering Practices
- Clear and readable Python code
- Modular structure using functions
- Reproducible workflow with Jupyter Notebook
- Version control using Git and GitHub

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
